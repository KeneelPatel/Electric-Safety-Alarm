# Electric Safety Alarm
This project uses 7 segment display, ultrasonic ranger, buzzer and Tivaware Launchpad. In this project, we are measuring the distance between the object and the electric line using the ultrasonic ranger and we are using the seven segment display to display the distance. On a quick note, we are using inches as out unit and the ultrasonic ranger has a capacity to detect object at most 50 inches far. We are also using the distance values to generate the specific pitch and frequency sound using the buzzer. So, as the distance between the objects gets closer, the frequency goes up and buzzer starts making the louder sound.
